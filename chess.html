          <h5>Ideation and Iteration</h5>
          <p>This chess set stemmed from my desire to want to explore using laser cutters to turn 2D designs into functional and visually appealing products. In the brainstorming process, I decided that I wanted my chess set to have two key components: a way for pieces to stay on the board without sliding, and a way to store the peices. I also wanted to create an appealing design through interlocking 2D wooden pieces designed in SketchUp and manufactured using laser cutting.</p>
          <!-- <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/matcha2.png"/> -->
        

        
          <h5>UX Testing and Iteration</h5>
          <p>In order to create an appealing design, this product went through user testing with peers in which they were asked questions about the design and feel of the pieces based on prototypes. The biggest goal in terms of user satisfaction was that the pieces were visually appealing and easy to place, yet also sturdy enough and cohesive enough with the board so that they did not move in case the board was bumped.</p>
          <!-- <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/matcha1.png"/> -->
       

        
          <h5>Development</h5>
          <p>The development for this product was based largely in SketchUp models in which I used 3D modeling techniques to ensure the size, shape, and final outcome of my project were functional and appealing. I created several 3D prototypes based on sketches I created in the ideation phase, and user tested with these prototypes to see how the design of the pieces and board would be received by users. The final phase of this project was the manufacturing phase, in which I used 1/8 inch wood panels and a laser cutter to cut out the 2D designs and then slot and glue them together into the final product.</p>
       

        
          <h5>Design Reception</h5>
          <p>The design, product video, 3D models, and final product were well received by peers, with several wishing to purchase the set. The final manufacture was clean, easy to use, and visually appealing according to several mentors and peers.</p>
