        <p>Combining a passion for the Colorado outdoors and alpine environments and my desire to learn new JS libraries, I explored ways in which I could use new techniques in order to incorporate visually enticing and interactive features into my informational website. This project was a great learning opportunity in both understanding how to develop a website whose design furthers its purpose as well as advancing my skills technically. Using the Three.js library, I was able to incorporate 3D models of each of the plants I cataloged, which was a great learning experience and also provided a nuanced visual element.</p>

          <h5>Design Process</h5>
          <p>The design process for this website was fairly in depth as I had to consider my skill level, learning a new library, and taking time to reflect on user feedback into my project. I had a clear idea of how I wanted the website to look and had to spend a lot of time working with Three.js and learning how to layer images in order to get the desired effect. One of the most difficult elements was the layered-image collage on the home page of the website, which took a lot of experiementing to get correct. Learning Three.js was an involved and interesting process, but after designing this website, I feel more confident in my abilities.</p>

          <h5>UX Testing and Iteration</h5>
          <p>In order to conduct UX testing for this project, I participated in a critique in which I presented the work that I had so far to a large group and asked what their overall impression of the design, functionality, and overall appeal of the website. This feedback was greatly helpful moving forward into the next iteration of my design. Some of this feedback included the fact that my original design which included several 3D models on one page was difficult to navigate and that the loading time took far too long due to the volume of 3D models. So, I opted for the method of layering images on top of one another in order to get the hovering pop-up effect I desired, which made for a cleaner and more user-friendly design.</p>

          <h5>Development</h5>
          <p>The development process for this project required a lot of hands-on learning with the Three.js library. It took trial and error in order to figure out the correct camera angle for the 3D models I wanted to implement, how to scale the models, which kinds of models I could implement, and then integrating those skills with the web development skills I already had. I started by just playing with the Three.js library, and molded the design of my website around the new skills that I gained.</p>

          <h5>Design Reception</h5>
          <p>This project was well recieved by peers, with a particular interest in and enthusiam for the click-and-drag feature for the 3D models. They found the home page design appealing and the website easy to nativigate. Overall, the design and build was well received.</p>
