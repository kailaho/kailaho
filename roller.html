        <p>This was a client-based project focused on addressing a the needs of a teacher of children with autism, who expressed that many of her students were comforted and helped by deep pressure therapy. She wanted a device that could be housed in a desk that her students could interact with and experience deep pressue therapy to help calm them through compression. Our design team focused on these needs and worked to rapidly prototype and create a functional final product. Collaborators: Phoenix Bloomfield, Hannah Wilson, Tim Houck</p>

          <h5>Ideation and Iteration</h5>
          <p>The design process for this project was largely on the needs of a client that is a teach of students with autism. She was connected to us through our professor, Melinda Picket-May, who expressed her desires for a deep pressure therapy device for classroom use. She wanted the device to be small enough to fit in a desk so that her students could use it during the day to help them stay focused during lessons. Based on these desires, we ideated as a group to come up with different methods for how we could implement a large but safe amount of pressure within the desk to create the desired compression effect.</p>

          <h5>UX Testing and Iteration</h5>
          <p>The user testing for this product was based largely on the relationship between our professor and client, who felt the most comfortable communicating in this fashion. Unfortunately, the scope of this project was limited to designing based on her initial desires and then her sending more details about the dimensions of the desk. Due to this limited relationship, the scope of our user testing was not able to reach actual students, even though this would have been very valuable.</p>
          <!-- <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/matcha1.png"/> -->
       

        
          <h5>Development</h5>
          <p>The development of this project was focused largely on safety and creating a kid-friendly and functional design that met our client's request. This meant that we had several iterations of prototypes and ideation for the mechanism that created the pressure, how the design worked with the shape of the desk, and safety features. We decided to use acryclic to mitigate the chance of splinters and other material hazards, as well as enclosing the ball bearings and bungee cords that created the tension in a safe box so that fingers could not become crushed.</p>
       

        
          <h5>Design Reception</h5>
          <p>The final product was ulitmately sent to the client and extremely well received. She was able to mount it in the desk and her students were able to use it during instructional time.</p>
